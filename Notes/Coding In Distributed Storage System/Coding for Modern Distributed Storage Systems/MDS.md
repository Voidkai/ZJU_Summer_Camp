# MDS(Maximum Distance Separable)

## Definition:

For the given [[n,k,d\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_code#Popular_notation) codeword*, MDS(Maximum Distance Separable)* is classified as one of the pivotal class in error correcting codes that meet the [Singleton bound](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_bound) $ d=n-k+1$ where,

1. $d$ is the distance that is the minimum number of position in which any 2 codewords differ (Hamming distance).
2. $n$ is the block length or the length of the codewords . the number of symbols or bits in a code.
3. $k$ is the dimension of the codeword.
